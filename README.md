# Advanced CSS Challenge - Professional Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this repo is to create my first professional portfolio utilizing advanced CSS and HTML. Within this repo and the files therein, the page ultimately will display a bio of who I am and links to projects that I have completed. This will allow for my portfolio to be seen on a public platform in order for potential employers to easily works that I have successfully completed. The works will demonstrate the skillsets that I have acquired, or those that I am working on.
